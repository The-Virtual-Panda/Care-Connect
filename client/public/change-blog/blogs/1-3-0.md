## [v1.3.0] – July 30th, 2025

A little polish, a little patchwork, and some support for people juggling more than one organization.

### Added

- ☎️ Added phone details to the phone configuration page — now with more context, fewer mysteries.

### Fixed

- 🧩 Multiple organizations are now fully supported.
- 🧹 Fixed the "Past Shifts" filter on a phone's Shift Configuration. It should now behave like a polite, well-trained filter.
- 🗓️ Usability fix: the end date on shift entry now defaults to the selected start date
