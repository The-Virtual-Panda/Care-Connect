## [v1.4.0] – August 1st, 2025

Now you can read release notes here in our change blog from within the app itself - ("Changelog Blog" = change blog 😆). Keep track of all the latest changes and know where your hard-earned money is going. Don't care? Well we covered that too with an opt-out mechanism.

### Added

- 📝 **Release Notes Page** – You can now see all the application's latest changes right here in the app
- ⚙️ **Opt-Out Setting** – Added a new account setting that lets you opt out of notifications if you find them bothersome. (Though we’ll miss you.)

### Changed

- 🎨 Updated visuals throughout the app for improved dark mode compatibility. Enjoy clearer text and a more consistent look
