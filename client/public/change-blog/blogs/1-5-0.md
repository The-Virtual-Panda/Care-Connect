## [v1.5.0] â€“ August 14th, 2025

Two big upgrades this time: thereâ€™s now a shiny billing portal link so you can manage all the money stuff without digging around or contacting support, and navigating organizations just got way smoother.

### Added

- ðŸ’³ **Billing Portal** â€“ Added to the organization dropdown. This link takes you to Stripe, where you can:
  - Manage payment methods
  - Manage organization billing info
  - Download previous invoices

*FYI: The 'customer' for Care Connect is the organizations, not you personally. Cards, billing info, and invoices belong to the organization.*

### Changed

- Site routing now supports organizational identifiers, making navigation friendly for bookmarks and multi-org scenarios
  - Previously: Recipients list was located at `/recipients`
  - Now: Located at `organization/{org}/recipients`

### Fixed

- Fixed a visual bug on mobile sidebar
- Aligned popup messages to the bottom-center of the screen on mobile
