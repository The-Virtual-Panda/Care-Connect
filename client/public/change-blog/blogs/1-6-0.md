## [v1.6.0] â€“ September 2nd, 2025

Big one here: you can now spy (legally) on all the call activity happening in your org. The new **Call History** page hooks directly into your Twilio account and pulls live data, so youâ€™ll always know who called, when, and how it went. No dusty logs required.

### Added

- ðŸ“ž **Call History Page** â€“ View all calls made on your organizationâ€™s Twilio account in real time. Includes:
  - Status (completed, failed, no-answer, etc.)
  - Direction (incoming/outgoing)
  - Call details (from, to, duration, cost, and call ID)
  - Filters for quickly finding that one call you *swear* happened
